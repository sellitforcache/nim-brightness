	abstractNote={The authors have built and tested a simplified full scale model of the planned liquid hydrogen moderator for the cold neutron source of the NIST reactor. The heat load to the liquid 	hydrogen will be removed to an external refrigerator by means of a thermosyphon. The authors’ experiments showed that this system could be filled, would operate stably, and the gas volume in the 	moderator chamber would not exceed 20 percent. Results of the tests suggested some improvements to the original designs. The circulation of liquid hydrogen proved to be self-regulating even when the 	available liquid inflow rate was sufficient to flood the vapor line.},
