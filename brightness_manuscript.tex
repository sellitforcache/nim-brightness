\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The Swiss Spallation Neutron Source (SINQ) is a spallation neutron source driven by a continuous 590 MeV proton beam at the Paul Scherrer Institut in Villigen, Switzerland.  The incoming protons impinge on a lead target cooled with heavy water, producing high energy neutrons.  These neutrons are moderated by the tank of D$_2$O surrounding the target.  The cold source is a 20 liter volume of liquid D$_2$ at approximately 25 K located within the D$_2$O moderator tank with its innermost face approximately 35 cm away from the center of the target.  It serves to further reduce the energies of the ``thermal'' neutrons coming from the D$_2$O tank into a regime that is more useful to instruments which receive neutrons from its surface.  

There is an extended shutdown of SINQ ambitiously planned for 2018 which will provide an opportunity for changes to be made to the cold neutron source \cite{rueegg_icans}.  Any changes will require a large amount of calculations done to minimize risk and ensure good the proposed changes will benifit the facility and its users.  The brightness measureemtn presented in this paper is the first step in validating the computational models reuqired to carry out a sucessful upgrade.  

The brightness measurement was conducted on July 21, 2014 in the ICON beamline at SINQ.  ICON is the cold neutron imaging facility at the neutron spallation source SINQ. The beamline offers an aperture wheel to change beam intensity and collimation ratio, as well as large evaculated flight tubes to minimize losses from scattering in the air \cite{icon}.  ICON was chosen since it does not incorporate any neutron optics, has good collimation, and looks directly on the surface of the cold source.  This removes additional uncertainty associated with the current state of the neutron guides and the physics involved with neutron-refecltive surfaces.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:setup}

The layout of the experimental is shown in Figure \ref{fig:geom}, which is a horizonal cut of the MCNP model geometry.  The target and moderators are shown furthest to the right.  The vertical line is the shielding monolith boundary, which is mostly steel blocks.  The ICON bunker is to the left of the monolith, the walls of which are made of heavy concrete and are shown as retangular blocks.  

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graphics/geom_bw_labels.eps}
     \caption{Geometry \label{fig:geom} }
\end{figure}

The principle components in the neutron path, listed in increasing distance from the detector, were:

\begin{center} \underline{In-bunker components}\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Spherical $^3$He detector, 3.30 cm $\oslash$, sorrounded by 1 mm cadmium sheets on all sides except towards the pinhole collimator
  \item Cadmium aperture, 1 mm $\oslash$, 1 mm thick, 2 mm from the detector surface
  \item Iron pinhole collimator, immediately after the cadmium aperture, surrounded by heavy concrete, lead, and polyethylene shielding
  \item Sapphire crystals, 20x20mm faces, 80 mm total thickness, within the heavy concrete, lead, and polyethylene shielding
  \item Evacuated flight tubes with XXX mm thick aluminum faces, total length 
  \item Steel collimator, 50x50 mm aperature at xxx cm from detector
\end{enumerate}
\begin{center}\underline{In-pile components}\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
  \item Moveable Gd aperature wheel, set to the largest opening of 80 mm $\oslash$
  \item High energy shutters
  \item D$_2$O moderator tank
  \item Low pressure nozzle
  \item Liquid deuterium cold source
  \item Lead spallation target
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

The beamline entrance and cadmium sheet restricts the solid angle visible to the detector to $6.92\times10^{-4}$ steradians.  Five measurements were done in total: centered in the beam port, +20 mm away from center (towards the target), -20 mm away from center (away from the target), centered with beryllium at 77 K in the beamline to show the 4 \AA bin, and without sapphire or beryllium.Figure \ref{fig:det} shows a photograph of the $^3$He detector with the iron pinhole collimator positioned in front of it before the large shielding blocks and sapphire crystals were positioned.

\section{Simulations}
\label{sec:sim}
 


\subsection{MCNP}
\label{subsec:mcnp}

Simulations were done with MCNP6.1 and with ENDF/B-VII.1 data.  Thermal scattering data for the room temperature sapphire crystals were used \cite{sapp}, as were 77 K thermal scattering data for beryllium, 19 K data for ortho-/para-deuterium, 273 K data for heavy water, 273 K data for light water \cite{mcnp6}, and 25 K data for aluminum, and 25 K data for zirconium \cite{IKE}.  The aliumun and zirconium data are important for accurately simulating the transmission through the various hulls surrounding the deuterium in the cold source.  The model geometry of has already been shown in Figure \ref{fig:geom}, and was created to be as true-to-life as possible.  The target in use during the measurement was ``target 10'', which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:target}. This target had a hemisphereical beam entrance window, STIP samples, and some light water contamination in the inner cooling loop.  These features were modelled in the MCNP simulation \cite{target10}.

\begin{figure}[h!] 
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graphics/target.eps}
     \caption{Vertical cross section of the target MCNP model geometry. \label{fig:target}}
\end{figure}

Since the detector is very far away from the neutron source, special methods had to be used in order to gather sufficient statistics in a reasonable amount of time.  A point detector XXX \cite{mcnp}.  

Using a point detector would be a reasonable solution if only cancluated the flux was desired, but the brightness also depends on the view able solid angle of the detector system.   The physical system responds to a view limited by the pinhole collimator and cadmium sheet, which produces a small, finite spot on detector surface.  A point detector would only see a single point of this view and wouldn't represent the average brightness (the measured quantity).  If the point detector were placed at the focal point of the collimator,   The solid angle of each point could be calculated, multiple point detectors used, and their induvidual spectra averaged to produce the average brightness, but this more complicated situation can be avoided by using a DXTRAN sphere instead of a point detector. A DXTRAN sphere blah blah XXX \cite{mcnp}.  Unlike a point detector, a DXTRAN sphere as a extent, so it can capture all the angles visible to the detector instead of those that pass through a single point.  A point detector placed at the focal point of the collimator should have a similar repsonse, but 

\subsection{Detector \& Efficiency}
\label{subsec:eff}

The efficiency curve of the helium detector was also measured and compared to calculated curves.  Curves were calculated using a 1D model and 1/v cross sections as well as with a detailed MCNP model of the helium detector \cite{bonner_manual}.  The 1D model efficiency is shown in Eq. \ref{eqn:eff1}, where $\Sigma_{\textrm{stl}}$ is the stainless steel total macroscopic cross section, $\Sigma_{\textrm{He}}$ is the $^3$He absorbtion macroscopic cross section, $x_{\textrm{stl}}$ is the thickness of the detector's stainless steel shell, and  $D_{\textrm{stl}}$ is the diameter $^3$He volume.  The cross section wavelength dependence is shown in Eq. \ref{eqn:eff2}, where $a$ and $b$ are linear fit coefficients derived from cross section data.  

\begin{gather}
     \label{eqn:eff1} \epsilon(\lambda) = \exp \left(-\Sigma_{\textrm{stl}}(\lambda) x_{\textrm{stl}}\right)[1-\exp(-\Sigma_{\textrm{He}}(\lambda) D_{\textrm{He}})] \\
     \label{eqn:eff2} \Sigma_i(\lambda) = a_i\lambda+b_i
\end{gather}
